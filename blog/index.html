 <h2>CSS Positioning</h2>
     <p class="post-type">March 9th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

    <p>Relative, absolute and fixed positioning are probably one of the more difficult concepts to grasp in CSS, so here's my take on things.</p>

    <p>Typical code to position some using absolute positioning might look like this.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
      div {
          position: absolute;
          top: 300px;
          left: 300px;
      }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Divs by default are display: block; and position: static; they will follow the document flow and each form their own line. In general think of all elements as static; p tags or h1 tags etc (thou they do have different default display values</p>

    <p><strong>position: relative;</strong> is the first level of positioning. Applying position: relative; to an element allows you to position it using top, right, left, bottom. For example top: 40px;. It also enables z-index, which allows you to control the stackng order of the element.</p>

    <p><strong>position: absolute;</strong> has the same qualities of position relative with one key difference. It takes it's position from the nearest parent in the DOM with position relative. This is often desirable as it can give you more accurate control when positioning a nested div's deep within a wrapper.</p>

    <p><strong>position: fixed;</strong> positions the element relative to the viewport (the edge of the page) and It remains "fixed" when you scroll. It has limited utility and is generally used for fixed navigation bars at the top of a page (you know when you scroll the menu stays on top)</p>

    <p>Position is powerful, and is useful because it enables z-index and allows you to stack. But otherwise it should be used with caution and is not a replacement for more core positioning properties like margin, padding, display and float </p>

    <h3>When should I Use Position?</h3>
    <p>You should not need to declare a position value or use top, right, bottom, left for general layout. Margin, padding, float and display are the correct tools for structutural layout. This is because they do not disrupt the document flow.</p>
    <p>Positioning is normally used when you need to use stacking. Positioning enables the z-index. So if you need to stack a div something under or over another div then it's time for positioning</p>

    <h3>Document Flow</h3>
    <p>The biggest weakness and strength of position (besides z-index) is how it removes the element from the normal document flow. Remember that when you enable position relative and set a position or when you enable position absolute (with or without a position) you remove the element from the document flow. This means it wont "push" other content down the page. That normally breaks layouts, especially if the content is dynamic or via a CMS.</p>

    <h3>Handle With Care</h3>
      <p>Absolute positioning in particular should be handled with care. Always take a moment to consider if absolute positioning is really required. Could you change the design? Can you re-factor the markup so you can use margin and float? Can you use background images? etc</p>

        <h2>The DBC Culture</h2>
        <p class="post-type">March 1st 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>


        <p>The culture at DBC seems to have a large focus on personal development, not just technical learning. Many of the videos and articles I have read so far during the interview and Pahse 0 have an almost spiritual slant.</p>

        <p>DBC is always re-iterating the idea that it is a learning environment which is about challanging yourself, growth and working with others.</p>

        <p>What Shereef at 16:16 minutes was very interesting. He said many students will fear that they are total newbies and don't belong. On the flip side you might be afraid that you are to advanced for the course and you've just spent a lot of money to sit around and learn HTML.</p>

        <p>I can relate to both, I've been a front-end web designer for many many years, so I have experience with design, html, css and various CMS. When choosing this course I wanted to make sure I got a coruse that was sufficiently difficult and I wasnt repeating work I already knew.
        </p>

        <p>Having worked through Phase 0 curriculum and having met several of the other people in my cohort, I think this course has the right level. The caliber of applicants is so impressive. Physicsts, Graduates, Executives. Holy shit. These people will not hold me back, in fact I'm going to have to step. As Shereef said, we're all in this together and if we're open to learning and helping we can all elevate each other.

         <h2>Like a Version</h2>
         <p class="post-type">February 27th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>


    <p>
      Think about some of the greatest musicians of all time. Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, Deadmau5 (to be decided). What have they got in common? Their songs have all been covered and remixed dozens of times. People take their work and create derivitave works, sometimes better, sometimes worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programmers and developers do the same thing. They work on each others code. They modify, expand and contribute their own thoughts to the original source.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this they use version control. It allows everyone to have a copy of the original work and make changes. Better yet, a log is kept of all the previous versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with version control you can listen to original version of "all along the watchtower" by Bob Dylan and compare it to the far superior version by Jimi Hendrix. You can learn from both songs, can debate which is best, and ultimately decide to listen to the version we prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 popular version control systems today: <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDMQFjAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsubversion.apache.org%2F&ei=3zfwVJSBOMTd8AWhsoHQAQ&usg=AFQjCNEZW33MJDShWdWskAwiqFH4MXeNuA&bvm=bv.87269000,d.dGc">SVN</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgit-scm.com%2F&ei=GDjwVL_nDdDg8AWU4oHgBg&usg=AFQjCNHBOAWIJWLQ6wmj_GErAgGzWCkTbA">git</a>. SVN is mainly used by old people who work for Microsoft or program java. git is used by everyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who prefer git almost always use Github. They are not the same thing, but they compliment each other. Github allows people to share their version controled code over the web with ease. It acts as a server, offers an extended set of tools and has an elegant UI which makes the process of version control a hell of a lot easier then git alone provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if your going to build something or code something and you want other people to listen, give feedback and riff of your original work your going to need version control. And the popular choice is git combined with Github.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Let's look at the following example of how version control improved the song "Bridges" by Brood.</strong> What parts from the Meg Mac cover would you merge?
