            <h2>How To Ask A Question</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 25th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>Asking a good technical question actually takes quite a bit of practice. </p>

            <p><strong>Be Prepared, Be Specific, Be Respectful</strong></p>
            
            <p>Asking a good question requires preperation. Before you ask a question, obviously you should search and research yourself. Most of the time you will find an answer.</p>

            <p>If you cannot find the right answer, keep an eye of the articles and answers you do find. They may contain terminology, code examples or other comments that help you further refine your original question. Sometimes you realise you are searching for the wrong thing altogether.</p>

            <p>Which leads us to the next part of asking a good question, and that is articulating the problem in enough detail that it's possible and easy for people to answer. This is very important. If the question is troubleshooting, you should include information on the error, what you did leading up to the error, and any other information that might be relevant to <strong>recreate</strong> the error. Sometimes it is helpful for the person helping you to recreate the error themselves, making it faster to solve</p>

            <p>If it's a code question you should probably include some code example, especially if you are asking what's wrong with the code. Be mindful that if you do not know the code, typing random code that you think is correct could be confusing. So if you cant supply a legit code example it might be best to reframe your question</p>

            <p>Finally this whole process should be respectful. When you ask someone to help you, you are asking them to give up their time. So preparing the question and providing consice and relevant details is a must. You should also prove that you have tried to solve the question on your own with research and trial and error. Nobody likes the guy who keeps asking simple questions just because it's easy. That's what google is for.</p>

            <h2>Conflict</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 17th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>I recently had a conflict explode that had been brewing for quite some time. Perhaps it was petty, but it was an issue for me that 

            <p>At my business, in the middle of the CBD there are limited car parks. My business is above a cafe and has a gravel small gravel parking area that I juggle to fit my staff and client parking into.</p> 

            <!-- <p>Generally there are a couple of parks available, as I only have 1-2 client arrivals a day. So I'm not to worried if cafe customers park, grab a takeaway coffee and leave. I get along well with the couple that owns the cafe and as long as their customers were respectful and used the parking fairly and occasionly I turned a blind eye.</p>-->

            <p>But the same customer from the cafe downstairs started parking in this area EVERY DAY and would keep his car there for hours on end while he sipped coffee or went and did who knows what.</p>

            <p>So i began to park him when I arrived in the morning, and then around lunch he would toddle upstairs and ask me to move my car. I couldn't believe it, was he not getting the obvious message?</p>

            <p>Anyway this went on for several weeks, maybe I parked him in once a week. Until one day he came up stairs to ask me to move my car and I just went mental at him. I told him get the F**K out of my office, that he couldn't park there. Who did he think he was?</p>

            <p>Why did this car parking issue grow into a fiery explosion? Well I can tell you that every morning I arrived at work and saw him using that car park I felt ripped off. I paid the rent, and if those car parks were full (as they sometimes were) my clients would have to park 5-10 minutes away in ticketed zones. It just wasn't fair. And furthermore I should not need to tell this dude what an a-hole he was being. It was obvious to the other 200 cafe customers that they couldn't park there (or they had enough decency not to)</p>

            <p>Why didn't I just tell him not to park there the first time? Well I guess the first few times I just thought it might seem a bit petty to immediately tell the guy to move his car RIGHT NOW. I mean people did park there sometimes to grab a quick takeaway coffee and sometimes there were several free parks available. That didn't bother me to much, because it had no negative effect on my business and I guess was kinda helpful for respectful people. </p>

            <p>Going back, I would tell him to move once I saw it happen more than once. I would walk into the cafe, tell him he cannot park there, finish your coffee sure but please do not park there again. I would explain why, and how his parking there affects me and my business. I am not being petty or greedy.</p>

            <h2>How the Internet Works (Har Har)</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 17th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>As you know, the internet is not a big truck. It's not something you just dump something on. it's a series of tubes.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f99PcP0aFNE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>Well maybe the senator had a point in there somewhere... The internet is tangled web of connections, fibre backbones, ethernet, copper wire, satellite and wireless towers</p>

            <p>How does all of that connect? How does information route through a network which is only semi planned and managed?</p>

            <p>I'm just going to spitball a bit, and tell you how I think it works based on my experience in web design and IT. It's probably not completely accurate, but it might be helpful and it will certainly be interesting to put those thoughts to paper</p>

            <p>For data to be accessible it has to be stored and exist somewhere. All data is stored and served by computer servers. The internet itself doesn't store the data (in a cloud?), it just connects servers with each other and that forms coalesces into the internet. </p>

            <p>Each server available on the internet has an IP address. IP addresses probably look familiar - for example: 209.120.182.130. Thats how we access the data or interact with that server. We lookup it's IP address and send and receive commands.</p>

            <p>Now you might think, how is there enough IP Addresses for all the servers in the world? That is made possible because IP Addresses can be subdivided. When they are subdivided you create networks inside of networks</p> 

            <p>This allows each IP holder to create a massive network of IP Addresses within there own IP. So in a sense when you route to an IP Address you might route deep into multiple networks, not just the top level "internet"</p>

            <p>For example let's say you want to access facebook.com (I'll discuss DNS in a moment - which is how names are translated into IP Addresses) What might happen?</p>

            <p>You goto access facebook.com and you are routed to the IP Address 209.120.182.130. But wait you have not reached facebook.com, you've actually reached the entrance point into facebooks network. Once you reach 209.120.182.130 it routes you inside of it's own network to 192.168.0.200 and that's where facebook.com is accessible. This means facebook can have hundreds of thousands of IP's for all it's software, website etc all served off the one top level IP of 209.120.182.130.</p>

            <p>This same approach happens on local networks, private networks etc etc. When you connect to the internet you are given an IP by your ISP, say 192.168.0.200 and you connect out through the ISP on 220.100.230.000. As you can see the same IP address 192.168.0.200 exists more than once on the internet, but clearly your laptop is not the same server as the facebook website.</p>

            <p>But how does the internet know which IP Address to route to? If someone wants to access facebook.com why does it goto Facebook and not to your computer?</p>

            <p>That's where DNS comes in. Domain Name System. DNS assigns human friendly names to IP Addresses. So facebook.com would equal 209.120.182.130. When you lookup facebook.com it takes you to that IP and from there that IP sends you to 192.168.0.200 WITHIN the facebook subnet.</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell DNS is one of the few centrally managed "services" of the internet. Someone must be responsible for keeping track of all the web addresses and mapping there IP's. So that when people query a name it often first routes through these central name servers and then swims back into the tangled mix of public and private networks.</p>

            <p>So yeah, that's the basics as I see it. I've probably made a fool of myself because it's far more complex, but maybe my view has been helpful for you to visualize the internet as more then a dump truck.</p>

            <h2>Values</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 12th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</p>

            <p>ambition, creativiy, friendships, pleasure, justice, wisdom</p>

            <p>Of these values do I try to live up to them? I try to. When I feel I have broken my core values, I do reflect.</p>

            <p>Wisdom is important to me, because it distills reason, empathy and experience. From this position we can give great advice, judge ourselves with perspective and learn from our failures.</p>

            <p>I last gave advice to a friend of mine who is trying to be a muscian (electronic music producer). He is very talented but never finishes his music and is not publishing his work. I felt I could offer advice because we both respect each other, and I have experienced the struggle of designing and building creative projects many times.</p>

            <h2>Ruby Hashes VS JavaScript Objects</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 12th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>This week we learnt beginner JavaScript. Initially going to JavaScript from Ruby was a bit of a jolt. But I think that's because I'd just got used to the Ruby syntax.</p>

            <p>In JavaScript the workhorses seem to be functions and objects. JavaScript has only 1 variable type, and it's global, so you rely more on scope.</p> 

            <p>Some of the obvious syntax differences in JavaScript are that most functions need to wrapped in parenthesis () and you need to terminate lines with semicolons ;</p>

            <p>Ruby Hashes are similar to JavaScript Objects. JavaScript objects are declared as variables and contain key/value pairs.</p>

            <p>In Ruby hashes were the used occasionally, and arrays were more common. Ruby hashes often seemed troublesome to access.</p>

            <p>From my limited experience with JavaScript thus far it seems that JavaScript objects are commonly used. It may be that defining nested objects in JavaScript is clearer and adding, removing and accessing parameters just seems more natural. So we naturally use them more often.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
ruby_hash = { 
  "a" => 1,
  "b" => 1, 
  "c" => 2 
}</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var javascriptHash = { 
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3
}</code></pre>

<p>What I liked about the JavaScript object was the ease in which you can create and read a nested data structure.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var athlete = {
  robert = {
    name: "Robert",
    height: 190,
    sport: "Baseball",
    quote: "Imma get you boy",
    win: ""
  }
  chris = {
    name: "Chris",
    height: 170,
    sport: "Baseball",
    quote: "cant touch this",
    win: ""
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Adding, removing or updating parameters in a Javascript is a breeze and has a nice syntax</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Update the sport for the Athlete Robert
athlete.robert.sport = "Bob";
// Add a new paramter to the Athlete chris
athlete.chris.eyecolor = "brown";
</pre></code>

            <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 5th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>Stereotype threat is an academic idea which argues people in minorities will take on the negative traits of a stereotype in certain situations.</p>

            <p>Of particular concern is how sterotype threat affects the academic and career performance of racial miniorities and women.</p>

            <p>"Stereotype threat is a potential contributing factor to long-standing racial and gender gaps in academic performance."</p>

            <p>I don't know as I have ever been affected by stereotype threat myself. However I certainly have moments of self doubt, anxiety etc.</p>


            <blockquote>Relationships based on trust and respect. Employment based on merit and performance.</blockquote>

            <p>This is a big issue, no doubt. And race, nor gender should hinder the opportunities for an individual. Relationships based on trust and respect. Employment based on merit and performance. These are standards to which we should strive.</p>


            <p>Stereotypes exist, and we box people into them all the time. When I find myself sterotyping someone, especially negatively I remind myself "I don't know this person at all. They could be really interesting, they could be amazing. It takes time to know who someone really is."</p>

            <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 5th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>Ruby has the following variables. Each variable type has a different <em>variable scope.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
  $global_var = 10
  CONSTANT = 10
  @@class_var = 10
  @instance_var = 10
  local_var = 10</code></pre>

  <h3>Local Variables</h3>
  <p>local variables have the most limited scope. They are limited to the method or loop in which they are declared. The location and depth of the local variable will determine inheritance. </p>

  <pre><code class="language-ruby">
def local
    (1..5).each do |x|
      var = x
    end
    p var #=> undefined local variable or method `var' for main:Object
end</code></pre>

  <p>If we declare the variable <code>var</code> above the loop it will be available to the entire method</p>

 <pre><code class="language-ruby">
def local
    var = 0
    (1..5).each do |x|
      var = x
    end
    p var #=> 5
end</code></pre>

<h3>Class Variables</h3>
  <p>A Class variable is available to all instances of the class.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-ruby">
class Ticket
  def initialize(price)
    @@price = price
  end
  def check_ticket_price
    p @@price
  end
end
ticket_one = Ticket.new(15)
ticket_one.check_ticket_price #=> 15
ticket_two = Ticket.new(10)
ticket_one.check_ticket_price #=> 10

ticket_two.check_ticket_price #=> 10</code></pre>

<p>The downside to a class variable is that if <strong>any</strong> instance of the <code>Ticket</code> class updates the variable, it is updated everywhere. Not very useful for tickets with individual pricing is it?
</p>


<h3>Class Instance Variables</h3>
  <p>A Class instance variable is unique to each instance of a class. This avoids the problem above.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-ruby">
class Ticket
  def initialize(price)
    @price = price
  end
  def check_ticket_price
    p @price
  end
end
ticket_one = Ticket.new(15)
ticket_one.check_ticket_price #=> 15
ticket_two = Ticket.new(10)
ticket_one.check_ticket_price #=> 10

ticket_two.check_ticket_price #=> 15</code></pre>

<p>Now we can spawn as many individual tickets as we like, each with there own price.
</p>

<h3>Global Variables</h3>
  <p>Global variables are accessible everywhere, no matter where they are declared.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-ruby">
def local
    (1..5).each do |x|
      $var = x
    end
end

p $var #=> 5</code></pre>

<p>Constants are the same as the $global_variable except when you try to change them they give you a warning.</p>

        <h2>Pairing & Feedback</h2>
        <p class="post-type">March 30th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

        <h3>Pairing</h3>

        <p>Pairing is enjoyable and I'm always keen to meet new members from my cohort. In that respect I think it's been great and it's helped  form a sense of community already.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the pairing sessions don't help me learn the material or complete a challenge any faster then I would on my own, which frustrated me at the beginning. But I've since decided that pairing is beneficial for many reasons and it's a unique aspect of this course that I should embrace.</p>

        <p>When pairing, cracking a difficult problem can be very rewarding and it's nice to share that with someone. </p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>

        <p>When I first started on the DBC course I was skeptical of the feedback system. But it's growing on me... The feedback system is helpful and I've already used it to improve myself. </p>

        <p>Everyone is very kind when writing their feedback which I think is what makes the specific and actionable parts of the feedback easier to accept. There are some real insights in some of the comments, specific things you can fix, delivered in a constructive and supporting way which makes it hard to reject them. </p>

        <p>Writing feedback was more reflective and considered then normal. I put this down to using the Actionable, Specific, Kind framework.</p>

        <p>I haven't faced any huge difficulties when writing feedback. I think I'd like to use the "lower" ratings a <em>litttle</em> bit more just because I think this will drive action for my peers. Obviously it still needs to be kind.

            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <p class="post-type">March 29th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>Classes are like groups. Classes allow you to define methods and variables inside of them and reuse them across multiple objects.</p>

            <p>Typically you would write a new class like so.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
  class Person
    def name
      name = "Rob"
    end
  end</code></pre>
          <p>You are then able to spawn new instances of that class object. These new objects have access to the methods and variables defined in the Class.<p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
  # Create new object which is an instance of the Person Class
  new_customer = Person.new
  p new_customer.name #=> "Rob"
  </code></pre>

          <p>So far, pretty easy right? You should be able to see the potenial of classes for everyday applications.</p>

          <p>Let's add the ability to change the name variable and see what happens</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class Person
  @first_name = ""
  def first_name
    @first_name
  end
  def change_first_name(name)
    @first_name = name
  end
end

new_customer = Person.new
p new_customer.first_name #=> nil
new_customer.change_name("Bob")
p new_customer.first_name #=> "Bob"</code></pre>

          <p>Now we've defined two methods in our class. One to display the first_name and the other to change it. We've also introduced a new type of variable @first_name which is called a class instance variable. The local variable we were using did not have enough scope to talk between the seperate methods #first_name and #change_first_name. </p>

          <p>There is also a third variable called a class variable which looks like @@first_name. Class variables are inherited by new class instances and class instances of descendant classes. But if you change a class variable anywhere it will change everywhere, which may not be desirable.</p>

          <p>Other important concepts that go with Classes are attributes, understanding class variables vs class instance variable scope and inheritence, understanding context and self and how that applies to class objects and the main class.</p>

            <h2>Regulation</h2>
            <p class="post-type">March 22nd 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>This week we've been asked to research and provide our opinion on an issue facing the tech industry. I feel regulation is the largest looming threat to technology.</p>

            <p>Most would agree that regulation stifles innovation, but that some degree of regulation is needed to stop "bad things happening".</p>

            <p>My concern is that more often than not, regulation is actually used as a tool by the government to protect existing political or private interests. </p>

            <p>Relevant examples at the moment include AirBNB, Uber, Bitcoin and the erosion of privacy on Facebook and Google.</p>

            <p><strong>Uber: </strong>An entrenched cab union and lucrative licensing fees for local and state governments conspire to stop competition under the pretense of public safety. Uber is a cheaper, more efficient and relatively safe way for people to travel. (just as safe as cabs)</p>

            <p><strong>AirBNB</strong> People choose AirBNB because it's a cheaper and more human experience - It's the opposite of a hotel. But the hotel lobby and government think it should operate MORE like a hotel. Maybe one day AirBNB will just be another hotel booking aggregator. </p>

            <p>In both scenarios we see great new services which are making travel and accommodation cheaper and more flexible for hundreds of thousands of people.<p>

            <p>But they risk being regulated to the point of uncompetitiveness - restricting the innovations that made them so popular in the first place seems pointless and short sighted to me. Especially because the reasons for the regulation are often dubious and flimsy.</p>

            <h2>Ruby .map Method</h2>
            <p class="post-type">March 22nd 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>Ruby provides various methods to iterate over arrays and hashes. The array and hash classes both come with the <code class="language-none">#each</code> method which you are probably familiar with.</p>

            <p>But there are several other powerful methods available, they are called enumerable methods such as <code class="language-none">#map</code>, <code class="language-none">#select</code> and <code class="language-none">#group_by</code>. They are available to the <code class="language-none">Array</code> and <code class="language-none">Hash</code> classes via the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Enumerable.html">Enumerable Module.</a>

            <p>Ive decided to review <code class="language-none">#map</code> because I've used it in several of my solutions this week. Review the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Enumerable.html#method-i-map">Ruby documentation for map</a></p>

            <p>The map method provides a powerful and consice way to re-build (re-map) an array based on certain conditions. </p>

            <p><strong>Using .map to re-build an array and perform logic on each iteration</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
array = [1,2,3,4]
array.map { |i| i * i }
#=> [1, 4, 9, 16]</code>
</pre>

 <p><strong>Using .map in a chain of methods. Split a single number into an array and perform logic on each iteration</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
def number_split(number)
  number.to_s.split("").map {|i| i = "Number " + x }
end

number_split(28434)
#=> ["Number 2", "Number 8", "Number 4", "Number 3", "Number 4"]</code>

            <p class="post-type">March 15th 2015 / Culture Blog</p>


<p>How do I Think? And how is it affecting my learning competency so far at DBC?</p>

<p>Well according to the "test" they made me take, I'm a multi modal learner. But I don't really put much stock in those 10 minute pseudo psych tests where you can tell how each answer will classify you.</p>

<p>So I'm just going to walk you through how I solve a typical problems, specifically in software and design. These might not be nirvana inspiring revelations here, but it's 9am Monday morning.</p>

<p>Normally when I presented with new problems I judge weather I can tackle the problem using previous knowledge, educated guesses and trial and error.</p>

<blockquote><p>
    These might not be nirvana inspiring revelations here, but it's 9am Monday morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once I hit a wall, I'll Google the problem or occasionally ask a peer whom I feel may have that knowledge (and isn't busy) - </p>
<p>When Googling I take care to frame the problem specifically and try to use the correct terminology. So I consider being able to identify and articulate the problem very important to effective learning. Often If I cannot articulate the problem I will shift from researching the direct problem and read a spread of information before returning to the problem at hand. </p>

<p>I prefer results with documentation, written tutorials and code examples to learn from. I don't like videos or audio, because it's much harder to control the pace (ie skip over the first few paragraphs because you know that bit already) and videos are just not tangible like pages. You can't copy text, or snippets. You can't inspect the page or the source files etc. These things are really helpful for learning to code.</p>

<p>I also learn from Q&A, but often I become frustrated because sometimes I cannot control my learning direction (even if it's the wrong direction). I often find when learning by asking I move backwards and start too broad, then become fixated on narrow details. I've often thought about this. I think when I try to understand something I cant just mimic a step in the middle, because I consider that useless copying. So I try to draw as much context as I can initially and then validate concepts by checking several different details work.</p>

<p>I will think more on my learning style in Q&A situations. I think this is an important area of growth for me. I am actively aware of keeping a growth mindset and would like to improve several of my learning styles over the course of DBC. Let's start with Q&A.</p>

            <h2>Yarrr, Arrays & Hashes</h2>
            <p class="post-type">March 15th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>Arrays and hashes store collections of objects. Objects in the array can then be accessed in various ways depending on your requirements.</p>


            <p>The items in an array or has can be strings, integers even another array. Pretty much anything which is an object can be stored in an array. </p>


            <p>Arrays are always made of key:value pairs. In an Array the key is a sequentially assigned integer. Hashes allow the key to be defined by the user.</p>

            <p>Let's look at some examples of creating, reading and accessing an Array</p>

            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p><strong>Creating an Array</strong> You can create an array several ways.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
# Create Array literal
array = []
# Create Array Explicit
array = Array.new</code>
</pre>
            <p><em>Unfortunately at this point I cannot tell if literal or explicit is better, or why you would use one over the other. My very basic understanding is that the literal invocation is simple a shortcut for the explicit. In practice, so far, I have just used the literal invocation.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Example Array with key:value pairs shown below</strong></p>
<pre>
<code class="language-ruby">array = [1,2,3,"cat","dog","pig"]
# array keys [0,1,2,3,4,5]
# array values: [1,2,3,"cat","dog","pig"]</code>
</pre>
<p><em>Note: In an array the index begins at 0.</em></p>


<p><strong>Accessing an object in the array</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
array[0]
# Would access the Array index 0 (the key) and return an integer value of 1
array[3]
# Would access the Array index 3 (the key) and return an string value of "cat"</code>
</pre>


<h3>Hashes</h3>
<p>Hashes are similar to arrays but as mentioned earlier you can define the <strong>key</strong> as well as the value. Perhaps this is useful when more semantic data storage and lookup is a requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Create a new Hash</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
hash = Hash.new()</code>
</pre>

<p><strong>Example Hash</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">hash = {
    "Galaxy" => "cat"
    "Minty" => "dog"
    "Arty" => "dog"
}</code>
</pre>
<p><strong>Access a Hash</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
hash["Galaxy"] #=> cat
# Would access the Hash index "Galaxy" (the key) and return a string value of "cat"</code></pre>

 <h2>CSS Positioning</h2>
     <p class="post-type">March 9th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

    <p>Relative, absolute and fixed positioning are probably one of the more difficult concepts to grasp in CSS, so here's my take on things.</p>

    <p>Typical code to position some using absolute positioning might look like this.</p>


<pre>
<code class="language-css">
div {
    position: absolute;
    top: 300px;
    left: 300px;
}</code>
</pre>

    <p>Divs by default are display: block; and position: static; they will follow the document flow and each form their own line. In general think of all elements as static; p tags or h1 tags etc (thou they do have different default display values</p>

    <p><strong>position: relative;</strong> is the first level of positioning. Applying position: relative; to an element allows you to position it using top, right, left, bottom. For example top: 40px;. It also enables z-index, which allows you to control the stacking order of the element.</p>

    <p><strong>position: absolute;</strong> has the same qualities of position relative with one key difference. It takes it's position from the nearest parent in the DOM with position relative. This is often desirable as it can give you more accurate control when positioning a nested div's deep within a wrapper.</p>

    <p><strong>position: fixed;</strong> positions the element relative to the viewport (the edge of the page) and It remains "fixed" when you scroll. It has limited utility and is generally used for fixed navigation bars at the top of a page (you know when you scroll the menu stays on top)</p>

    <p>Position is powerful, and is useful because it enables z-index and allows you to stack. But otherwise it should be used with caution and is not a replacement for more core positioning properties like margin, padding, display and float </p>

    <h3>When should I Use Position?</h3>
    <p>You should not need to declare a position value or use top, right, bottom, left for general layout. Margin, padding, float and display are the correct tools for structutural layout. This is because they do not disrupt the document flow.</p>
    <p>Positioning is normally used when you need to use stacking. Positioning enables the z-index. So if you need to stack a div something under or over another div then it's time for positioning</p>

    <h3>Document Flow</h3>
    <p>The biggest weakness and strength of position (besides z-index) is how it removes the element from the normal document flow. Remember that when you enable position relative and set a position or when you enable position absolute (with or without a position) you remove the element from the document flow. This means it wont "push" other content down the page. That normally breaks layouts, especially if the content is dynamic or via a CMS.</p>

    <h3>Handle With Care</h3>
      <p>Absolute positioning in particular should be handled with care. Always take a moment to consider if absolute positioning is really required. Could you change the design? Can you re-factor the markup so you can use margin and float? Can you use background images? etc</p>

        <h2>The DBC Culture</h2>
        <p class="post-type">March 1st 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>


        <p>The culture at DBC seems to have a large focus on personal development, not just technical learning. Many of the videos and articles I have read so far during the interview and Pahse 0 have an almost spiritual slant.</p>

        <p>DBC is always re-iterating the idea that it is a learning environment which is about challanging yourself, growth and working with others.</p>

        <p>What Shereef at 16:16 minutes was very interesting. He said many students will fear that they are total newbies and don't belong. On the flip side you might be afraid that you are to advanced for the course and you've just spent a lot of money to sit around and learn HTML.</p>

        <p>I can relate to both, I've been a front-end web designer for many many years, so I have experience with design, html, css and various CMS. When choosing this course I wanted to make sure I got a coruse that was sufficiently difficult and I wasnt repeating work I already knew.
        </p>

        <p>Having worked through Phase 0 curriculum and having met several of the other people in my cohort, I think this course has the right level. The caliber of applicants is so impressive. Physicsts, Graduates, Executives. Holy shit. These people will not hold me back, in fact I'm going to have to step. As Shereef said, we're all in this together and if we're open to learning and helping we can all elevate each other.

         <h2>Like a Version</h2>
         <p class="post-type">February 27th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>


    <p>
      Think about some of the greatest musicians of all time. Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, Deadmau5 (to be decided). What have they got in common? Their songs have all been covered and remixed dozens of times. People take their work and create derivitave works, sometimes better, sometimes worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programmers and developers do the same thing. They work on each others code. They modify, expand and contribute their own thoughts to the original source.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this they use version control. It allows everyone to have a copy of the original work and make changes. Better yet, a log is kept of all the previous versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with version control you can listen to original version of "all along the watchtower" by Bob Dylan and compare it to the far superior version by Jimi Hendrix. You can learn from both songs, can debate which is best, and ultimately decide to listen to the version we prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 popular version control systems today: <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDMQFjAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsubversion.apache.org%2F&ei=3zfwVJSBOMTd8AWhsoHQAQ&usg=AFQjCNEZW33MJDShWdWskAwiqFH4MXeNuA&bvm=bv.87269000,d.dGc">SVN</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgit-scm.com%2F&ei=GDjwVL_nDdDg8AWU4oHgBg&usg=AFQjCNHBOAWIJWLQ6wmj_GErAgGzWCkTbA">git</a>. SVN is mainly used by old people who work for Microsoft or program java. git is used by everyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who prefer git almost always use Github. They are not the same thing, but they compliment each other. Github allows people to share their version controled code over the web with ease. It acts as a server, offers an extended set of tools and has an elegant UI which makes the process of version control a hell of a lot easier then git alone provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if your going to build something or code something and you want other people to listen, give feedback and riff of your original work your going to need version control. And the popular choice is git combined with Github.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Let's look at the following example of how version control improved the song "Bridges" by Brood.</strong> What parts from the Meg Mac cover would you merge?
