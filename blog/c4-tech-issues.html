            <h2>Regulation</h2>
            <p class="post-type">March 22nd 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>This week we've been asked to research and provide our opinion on an issue facing the tech industry. I feel regulation is the largest looming threat to technology.</p>

            <p>Most would agree that regulation stifles innovation, but that some degree of regulation is needed to stop "bad things happening".</p>

            <p>My concern is that more often than not, regulation is actually used as a tool by the government to protect existing political or private interests. </p>

            <p>Relevant examples at the moment include AirBNB, Uber, Bitcoin and the erosion of privacy on Facebook and Google.</p>

            <p><strong>Uber: </strong>An entrenched cab union and lucrative licensing fees for local and state governments conspire to stop competition under the pretense of public safety. Uber is a cheaper, more efficient and relatively safe way for people to travel. (just as safe as cabs)</p>

            <p><strong>AirBNB</strong> People choose AirBNB because it's a cheaper and more human experience - It's the opposite of a hotel. But the hotel lobby and government think it should operate MORE like a hotel. Maybe one day AirBNB will just be another hotel booking aggregator. </p>

            <p>In both scenarios we see great new services which are making travel and accommodation cheaper and more flexible for hundreds of thousands of people.<p>

            <p>But they risk being regulated to the point of uncompetitiveness - restricting the innovations that made them so popular in the first place seems pointless and short sighted to me. Especially because the reasons for the regulation are often dubious and flimsy.</p>
