        <h2>The DBC Culture</h2>
        <p class="post-type">March 1st 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>


        <p>The culture at DBC seems to have a large focus on personal development, not just technical learning. Many of the videos and articles I have read so far during the interview and Pahse 0 have an almost spiritual slant.</p>

        <p>DBC is always re-iterating the idea that it is a learning environment which is about challanging yourself, growth and working with others.</p>

        <p>What Shereef at 16:16 minutes was very interesting. He said many students will fear that they are total newbies and don't belong. On the flip side you might be afraid that you are to advanced for the course and you've just spent a lot of money to sit around and learn HTML.</p>

        <p>I can relate to both, I've been a front-end web designer for many many years, so I have experience with design, html, css and various CMS. When choosing this course I wanted to make sure I got a coruse that was sufficiently difficult and I wasnt repeating work I already knew.
        </p>

        <p>Having worked through Phase 0 curriculum and having met several of the other people in my cohort, I think this course has the right level. The caliber of applicants is so impressive. Physicsts, Graduates, Executives. Holy shit. These people will not hold me back, in fact I'm going to have to step. As Shereef said, we're all in this together and if we're open to learning and helping we can all elevate each other.

         <h2>Like a Version</h2>
         <p class="post-type">February 27th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>


    <p>
      Think about some of the greatest musicians of all time. Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, Deadmau5 (to be decided). What have they got in common? Their songs have all been covered and remixed dozens of times. People take their work and create derivitave works, sometimes better, sometimes worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programmers and developers do the same thing. They work on each others code. They modify, expand and contribute their own thoughts to the original source.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this they use version control. It allows everyone to have a copy of the original work and make changes. Better yet, a log is kept of all the previous versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with version control you can listen to original version of "all along the watchtower" by Bob Dylan and compare it to the far superior version by Jimi Hendrix. You can learn from both songs, can debate which is best, and ultimately decide to listen to the version we prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 popular version control systems today: <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDMQFjAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsubversion.apache.org%2F&ei=3zfwVJSBOMTd8AWhsoHQAQ&usg=AFQjCNEZW33MJDShWdWskAwiqFH4MXeNuA&bvm=bv.87269000,d.dGc">SVN</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgit-scm.com%2F&ei=GDjwVL_nDdDg8AWU4oHgBg&usg=AFQjCNHBOAWIJWLQ6wmj_GErAgGzWCkTbA">git</a>. SVN is mainly used by old people who work for Microsoft or program java. git is used by everyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who prefer git almost always use Github. They are not the same thing, but they compliment each other. Github allows people to share their version controled code over the web with ease. It acts as a server, offers an extended set of tools and has an elegant UI which makes the process of version control a hell of a lot easier then git alone provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if your going to build something or code something and you want other people to listen, give feedback and riff of your original work your going to need version control. And the popular choice is git combined with Github.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Let's look at the following example of how version control improved the song "Bridges" by Brood.</strong> What parts from the Meg Mac cover would you merge?
