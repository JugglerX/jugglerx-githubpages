            <h2>Pairing & Feedback</h2>
            <p class="post-type">March 30th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <h3>Pairing</h3>

            <p>Pairing is enjoyable and I'm always keen to meet new members from my cohort. In that respect I think it's been great and it's helped  form a sense of community already.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the pairing sessions don't help me learn the material or complete a challenge any faster then I would on my own, which frustrated me at the beginning. But I've since decided that pairing is beneficial for many reasons and it's a unique aspect of this course that I should embrace.</p>

            <p>When pairing, cracking a difficult problem can be very rewarding and it's nice to share that with someone. </p>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>

            <p>When I first started on the DBC course I was skeptical of the feedback system. But it's growing on me... The feedback system is helpful and I've already used it to improve myself. </p>

            <p>Everyone is very kind when writing their feedback which I think is what makes the specific and actionable parts of the feedback easier to accept. There are some real insights in some of the comments, specific things you can fix, delivered in a constructive and supporting way which makes it hard to reject them. </p>

            <p>Writing feedback was more reflective and considered then normal. I put this down to using the Actionable, Specific, Kind framework.</p>
<p>I haven't faced any huge difficulties when writing feedback. I think I'd like to use the "lower" ratings a <em>litttle</em> bit more just because I think this will drive action for my peers. Obviously it still needs to be kind.
