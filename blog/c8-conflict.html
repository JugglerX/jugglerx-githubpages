            <h2>Conflict</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 17th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>I recently had a conflict explode that had been brewing for quite some time. Perhaps it was petty, but it was an issue for me that 

            <p>At my business, in the middle of the CBD there are limited car parks. My business is above a cafe and has a gravel small gravel parking area that I juggle to fit my staff and client parking into.</p> 

            <!-- <p>Generally there are a couple of parks available, as I only have 1-2 client arrivals a day. So I'm not to worried if cafe customers park, grab a takeaway coffee and leave. I get along well with the couple that owns the cafe and as long as their customers were respectful and used the parking fairly and occasionly I turned a blind eye.</p>-->

            <p>But the same customer from the cafe downstairs started parking in this area EVERY DAY and would keep his car there for hours on end while he sipped coffee or went and did who knows what.</p>

            <p>So i began to park him when I arrived in the morning, and then around lunch he would toddle upstairs and ask me to move my car. I couldn't believe it, was he not getting the obvious message?</p>

            <p>Anyway this went on for several weeks, maybe I parked him in once a week. Until one day he came up stairs to ask me to move my car and I just went mental at him. I told him get the F**K out of my office, that he couldn't park there. Who did he think he was?</p>

            <p>Why did this car parking issue grow into a fiery explosion? Well I can tell you that every morning I arrived at work and saw him using that car park I felt ripped off. I paid the rent, and if those car parks were full (as they sometimes were) my clients would have to park 5-10 minutes away in ticketed zones. It just wasn't fair. And furthermore I should not need to tell this dude what an a-hole he was being. It was obvious to the other 200 cafe customers that they couldn't park there (or they had enough decency not to)</p>

            <p>Why didn't I just tell him not to park there the first time? Well I guess the first few times I just thought it might seem a bit petty to immediately tell the guy to move his car RIGHT NOW. I mean people did park there sometimes to grab a quick takeaway coffee and sometimes there were several free parks available. That didn't bother me to much, because it had no negative effect on my business and I guess was kinda helpful for respectful people. </p>

            <p>Going back, I would tell him to move once I saw it happen more than once. I would walk into the cafe, tell him he cannot park there, finish your coffee sure but please do not park there again. I would explain why, and how his parking there affects me and my business. I am not being petty or greedy.</p>
