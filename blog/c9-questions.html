            <h2>How To Ask A Question</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 25th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>Asking a good technical question actually takes quite a bit of practice. </p>

            <p><strong>Be Prepared, Be Specific, Be Respectful</strong></p>
            
            <p>Asking a good question requires preperation. Before you ask a question, obviously you should search and research yourself. Most of the time you will find an answer.</p>

            <p>If you cannot find the right answer, keep an eye of the articles and answers you do find. They may contain terminology, code examples or other comments that help you further refine your original question. Sometimes you realise you are searching for the wrong thing altogether.</p>

            <p>Which leads us to the next part of asking a good question, and that is articulating the problem in enough detail that it's possible and easy for people to answer. This is very important. If the question is troubleshooting, you should include information on the error, what you did leading up to the error, and any other information that might be relevant to <strong>recreate</strong> the error. Sometimes it is helpful for the person helping you to recreate the error themselves, making it faster to solve</p>

            <p>If it's a code question you should probably include some code example, especially if you are asking what's wrong with the code. Be mindful that if you do not know the code, typing random code that you think is correct could be confusing. So if you cant supply a legit code example it might be best to reframe your question</p>

            <p>Finally this whole process should be respectful. When you ask someone to help you, you are asking them to give up their time. So preparing the question and providing consice and relevant details is a must. You should also prove that you have tried to solve the question on your own with research and trial and error. Nobody likes the guy who keeps asking simple questions just because it's easy. That's what google is for.</p>
