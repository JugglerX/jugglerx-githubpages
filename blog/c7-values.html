            <h2>Values</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 12th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</p>

            <p>ambition, creativiy, friendships, pleasure, justice, wisdom</p>

            <p>Of these values do I try to live up to them? I try to. When I feel I have broken my core values, I do reflect.</p>

            <p>Wisdom is important to me, because it distills reason, empathy and experience. From this position we can give great advice, judge ourselves with perspective and learn from our failures.</p>

            <p>I last gave advice to a friend of mine who is trying to be a muscian (electronic music producer). He is very talented but never finishes his music and is not publishing his work. I felt I could offer advice because we both respect each other, and I have experienced the struggle of designing and building creative projects many times.</p>
