  <h1>The DBC Culture</h1>
  <h4>March 1st 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      The culture at DBC seems to have a large focus on personal development, not just technical learning. Many of the videos and articles I have read so far during the interview and Pahse 0 have an almost spiritual slant.
    </p>
    <p>DBC is always re-iterating the idea that it is a learning environment which is about challanging yourself, growth and working with others.

      What Shereef at 16:16 minutes was very interesting. He said many students will fear that they are total newbies and don't belong. On the flip side you might be afraid that you are to advanced for the course and you've just spent a lot of money to sit around and learn HTML.</p>
    <p>I can relate to both, I've been a front-end web designer for many many years, so I have experience with design, html, css and various CMS. When choosing this course I wanted to make sure I got a coruse that was sufficiently difficult and I wasnt repeating work I already knew.

    <p>Having worked through Phase 0 curriculum and having met several of the other people in my cohort, I think this course has the right level. The caliber of applicants is so impressive. Physicsts, Graduates, Executives. Holy shit. These people will not hold me back, in fact I'm going to have to step. As Shereef said, we're all in this together and if we're open to learning and helping we can all elevate each other.
