            <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 5th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>Stereotype threat is the concept in which people in minorities will take on the negative traits of a stereotype in certain situations.</p>

            <p>Of particular concern is how sterotype threat affects the academic and career performance of racial miniorities and women.</p>

            <p>I don't know as I have ever been affected by stereotype threat myself. However I certainly have moments of self doubt, anxiety etc.</p>

            <blockquote>Relationships based on trust and respect. Employment based on merit and performance.</blockquote>

            <p>This is a big issue, no doubt. And race, nor gender should hinder the opportunities for an individual. Relationships based on trust and respect. Employment based on merit and performance. These are standards to which we should strive.</p>

            <p>Stereotypes exist, and we box people into them all the time. When I find myself sterotyping someone, especially negatively I remind myself "I don't know this person at all. They could be really interesting, they could be amazing. It takes time to know who someone really is."</p>
