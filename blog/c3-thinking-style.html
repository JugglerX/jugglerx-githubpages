<p>How do I Think? And how is it affecting my learning competency so far at DBC?</p>

<p>Well according to the "test" they made me take, I'm a multi modal learner. But I don't really put much stock in those 10 minute pseudo psych tests where you can tell how each answer will classify you.</p>

<p>So I'm just going to walk you through how I solve a typical problems, specifically in software and design. These might not be nirvana inspiring revelations here, but it's 9am Monday morning.</p>

<p>Normally when I presented with new problems I judge weather I can tackle the problem using previous knowledge, educated guesses and trial and error.</p>

<p>Once I hit a wall, I'll Google the problem or occasionally ask a peer whom I feel may have that knowledge (and isn't busy) - </p>
<p>When Googling I take care to frame the problem specifically and try to use the correct terminology. So I consider being able to identify and articulate the problem very important to effective learning. Often If I cannot articulate the problem I will shift from researching the direct problem and read a spread of information before returning to the problem at hand. </p>

<p>I prefer results with documentation, written tutorials and code examples to learn from. I don't like videos or audio, because it's much harder to control the pace (ie skip over the first few paragraphs because you know that bit already) and videos are just not tangible like pages. You can't copy text, or snippets. You can't inspect the page or the source files etc. These things are really helpful for learning to code.</p>

<p>I also learn from Q&A, but often I become frustrated because sometimes I cannot control my learning direction (even if it's the wrong direction). I often find when learning by asking I move backwards and start too broad, then become fixated on narrow details. I've often thought about this. I think when I try to understand something I cant just mimic a step in the middle, because I consider that useless copying. So I try to draw as much context as I can initially and then validate concepts by checking several different details work.</p>

<p>I will think more on my learning style in Q&A situations. I think this is an important area of growth for me. I am actively aware of keeping a growth mindset and would like to improve several of my learning styles over the course of DBC. Let's start with Q&A.</p>
