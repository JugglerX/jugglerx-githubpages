            <p>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</p>

            <p>ambition, creativiy, friendships, pleasure, justice, wisdom</p>

            <p class="post-type">Apr 12th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>This week we learnt beginner JavaScript. Initially going to JavaScript from Ruby was a bit of a jolt. But I think that's because I'd just got used to the Ruby syntax.</p>

            <p>In JavaScript the workhorses seem to be functions and objects. JavaScript has only 1 variable type, and it's global, so you rely more on scope.</p>

<h2><a href="blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html">Stereotype Threat</a></h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 5th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>Stereotype threat is the concept in which people in minorities will take on the negative traits of a stereotype in certain situations.</p>

            <p>Of particular concern is how sterotype threat affects the academic and career performance of racial miniorities and women.</p>

            <h2><a href="blog/t6-oop-concepts.html">Variable Scope</a></h2>
            <p class="post-type">Apr 5th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>Ruby has the following variables. Each variable type has a different <em>variable scope.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
  $global_var = 10
  CONSTANT = 10
  @@class_var = 10
  @instance_var = 10
  local_var = 10</code></pre>

  <h3>Local Variables</h3>
  <p>local variables have the most limited scope. They are limited to the method or loop in which they are declared. The location and depth of the local variable will determine inheritance. </p>

        <p class="post-type">March 30th 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

        <p>Pairing is enjoyable and I'm always keen to meet new members from my cohort. In that respect I think it's been great and it's helped  form a sense of community already.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the pairing sessions don't help me learn the material or complete a challenge any faster then I would on my own, which frustrated me at the beginning. But I've since decided that pairing is beneficial for many reasons and it's a unique aspect of this course that I should embrace.</p>

            <p class="post-type">March 29th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>Classes are like groups. Classes allow you to define methods and variables inside of them and reuse them across multiple objects.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
  class Person
    def name

            <p class="post-type">March 22nd 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

            <p>This week we've been asked to research and provide our opinion on an issue facing the tech industry. I feel regulation is the largest looming threat to technology.</p>

            <p>Most would agree that regulation stifles innovation, but that some degree of regulation is needed to stop "bad things happening".</p>

            <p class="post-type">March 22nd 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

            <p>Ruby provides various methods to iterate over arrays and hashes. The array and hash classes both come with the <code class="language-none">#each</code> method which you are probably familiar with.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
array = [1,2,3,4]
array.map { |i| i * i }
#=> [1, 4, 9, 16]</code>
</pre>

<p>How do I Think? And how is it affecting my learning competency so far at DBC?</p>

<p>Well according to the "test" they made me take, I'm a multi modal learner. But I don't really put much stock in those 10 minute pseudo psych tests where you can tell how each answer will classify you.</p>

    <p class="post-type">March 15th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

    <p>Arrays and hashes store collections of objects. Objects in the array can then be accessed in various ways depending on your requirements.</p>

    <p class="post-type">March 8th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

    <p>Relative, absolute and fixed positioning are probably one of the more difficult concepts to grasp in CSS, so here's my take on things.</p>

        <p>The culture at DBC seems to have a large focus on personal development, not just technical learning. Many of the videos and articles I have read so far during the interview and Pahse 0 have an almost spiritual slant.</p>

      Think about some of the greatest musicians of all time. Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, Deadmau5 (to be decided). What have they got in common? Their songs have all been covered and remixed dozens of times. People take their work and create derivitave works, sometimes better, sometimes worse.
