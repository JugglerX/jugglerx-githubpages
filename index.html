<p>How do I Think? And how is it affecting my learning competency so far at DBC?</p>

<p>Well according to the "test" they made me take, I'm a multi modal learner. But I don't really put much stock in those 10 minute pseudo psych tests where you can tell how each answer will classify you.</p>

    <p>Arrays and hashes store collections of objects. Objects in the array can then be accessed in various ways depending on your requirements.</p>

    <p class="post-type">March 8th 2015 / Technical Blog</p>

        <p class="post-type">March 1st 2015 / Cultural Blog</p>

        <p>The culture at DBC seems to have a large focus on personal development, not just technical learning. Many of the videos and articles I have read so far during the interview and Pahse 0 have an almost spiritual slant.</p>

      Think about some of the greatest musicians of all time. Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, Deadmau5 (to be decided). What have they got in common? Their songs have all been covered and remixed dozens of times. People take their work and create derivitave works, sometimes better, sometimes worse.
