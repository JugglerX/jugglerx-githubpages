    <h1>Ruby</h1>

    <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
    <p>Ruby is the programming language Ruby on Rails is written in. So most of the time you will be writing Ruby code. Therefore it is good to grasp the basics of Ruby. If you just want to play with Ruby, type irb into your console to start interactive ruby. There you can easily experiment with Ruby. To leave irb, type exit.</p>

<p>This is just a very small selection of concepts. This is especially true later on when we talk about what Arrays, Strings etc. can do. For more complete information have a look at ruby-doc or search with your favorite search engine!</p>

<h4>Comment</h4>

<h5>Usage</h5>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
# Comment text  
</code></pre>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
# This text is a comment
some.ruby_code # A comment
# some.ignored_ruby_code
</code></pre>


<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Ruby ignores everything that is marked as a comment. It does not try to execute it. Comments are just there for you as information. Comments are also commonly used to comment out code. That is when you don't want some part of your code to execute but you don't want to delete it just yet, because you are trying different things out.</p>





<h4>Variables</h4>

<h5>Usage</h5>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
variable = some_value 
</code></pre>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
name = "Tobi"
name # => "Tobi"
sum = 18 + 5
sum # => 23
</code></pre>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>With a variable you tell Ruby that from now on you want to refer to that value by the name you gave it. So for the first example, from now on when you use name Ruby will know that you meant "Tobi".</p>
